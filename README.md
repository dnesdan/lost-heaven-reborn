# Lost Heaven Reborn

An independent Rust reimplementation of the Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven (2002) engine and game. The current build reads a user's original PC installation, displays the Czech PC menu layout and assets, and renders bounded static scenes. MISE01 inspection now assembles a small neighborhood around the authored player spawn with the original static taxi. It does not execute the cinematic, missions, or gameplay. The long-term goal is a complete campaign using the user's own legally obtained game data. No game assets are included.

## Build and run

Requires Rust 1.99.1, installed by the setup script. Linux uses wgpu with Vulkan; macOS is intended to use Metal. Dependencies are pinned in `Cargo.lock`.

```sh
./scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/test.sh
./scripts/run.sh --synthetic
```

Build the native engine binary with `cargo build --locked -p lhr-engine` from the repository root. These commands use the user's game installation directly:

```sh
./scripts/run.sh --root /path/to/Mafia
./scripts/run.sh --root /path/to/Mafia --mission mise01
./scripts/run.sh --root /path/to/Mafia --model models/4build101.4ds
```

The first command opens the Rust-rendered original menu. Up/Down and Enter select options; only New Game and Exit work, and there is no profile chooser. New Game switches to a static intro scene; Escape switches to the bounded MISE01 spawn-neighborhood inspection. This temporary inspection path does not play the original video/cinematic or execute missions or gameplay. Add `--headless --capture /tmp/scene.png` to either inspection command for a one-frame GPU capture, or `--frames N` to bound a window run. Camera inspection uses arrow keys and W/S. See [coverage](COVERAGE.md) for exact evidence and limits.

`setup.sh --graphics` prepares the Linux software Vulkan tools used for development captures. `scripts/test.sh` passes 74 Rust tests and 9 REA wrapper tests. On Linux x86_64, X11 input has been checked through menu, static INTRO and the MISE01 neighborhood, including orbit and reload. An Apple arm64 cargo check passes, but macOS linking and Metal runtime have not been tested. iOS is a future compatibility target. The original game's executable and REA are not gameplay runtime dependencies.

## Reverse engineering and assets

REA with Ghidra is the required analysis path for engine behavior. Keep original executables, installations, extracted or converted assets, analysis databases, decompiler output, credentials and private URLs outside Git. Public tests use synthetic fixtures. The reader supports selected PC DTA archives and bounded model, scene, menu and script-data formats; archive audio and checksum verification remain unsupported. Full city simulation, mission execution and campaign play are not implemented. Use a trusted, stable installation tree. PS2 material is used for research and comparison.
